    India is a land of many paradoxes. There are people who strive hard to earn their bread and butter here, and then there are people who have all the luxuries of life. There are cultures which are forward thinking and open to changes, and then there are cultures which strongly hold to their roots. There are many beautiful tourist places in India which are rugged and barren, and there are places which are blessed with lush greenery and amazing forests

And each one of those paradoxes of India is beautiful in its own right. You donâ€™t need to go looking for beauty in India. You come across it while exploring the land.
